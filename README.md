DRISHTI (‡§¶‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø): Intelligent Safety Stick for the Visually Impaired

An open-source, smart electronic travel aid to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals.

</div>

Project DRISHTI acts as an intelligent guardian by integrating multiple sensors to provide real-time environmental awareness and an automated emergency alert system.
The Problem

Traditional aids for the visually impaired have key limitations: they cannot detect head-level obstacles or ground-level hazards like puddles. Furthermore, summoning help quickly after a fall is a critical challenge. Commercial smart canes that solve these issues are often economically inaccessible, costing anywhere from ‚Çπ1500 to over ‚Çπ2000.
Our Solution

By leveraging an ESP32 microcontroller and common off-the-shelf components, DRISHTI offers a powerful, low-cost, and reliable open-source safety device that anyone can build.
‚ú® Key Features

    üëÅÔ∏è Proactive Obstacle Detection: An ultrasonic sensor detects forward obstacles within a 1-meter range, providing a 2-second haptic (vibration) warning.

    ü§∏ Automated Fall Detection: An integrated MPU-6050 accelerometer accurately detects the unique G-force signature associated with a user fall.

    üÜò Multi-Stage SOS System: Upon detecting a fall, a dual-alert system is immediately activated:

        Local Alarm: A loud, continuous buzzer sounds to alert people nearby.

        Remote Alert: Simultaneously, a Bluetooth LE signal is sent to a companion app, which automatically sends a pre-written emergency SMS to a designated contact.

    üí¨ Intuitive Feedback: The system uses distinct haptic feedback (vibration) for obstacles and audible alerts (buzzer) for emergencies.

    üîã Rechargeable Power: Powered by a standard 3.7V 18650 Li-ion battery with a TP4056 module for safe and easy USB charging.
