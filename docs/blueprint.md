## Core Features:

- Obstacle Alert: Provides vibration alerts based on proximity to forward obstacles detected by the phone's camera. The proximity calculation relies on input from the phone's camera and computer vision, and the threshold proximity can be set by the user.
- Ground Hazard Detection: Recognizes ground hazards using the phone's camera. Distinct vibration patterns alert the user to different hazards like steps or uneven surfaces.
- Fall Detection and Alert: Detects falls using the phone's accelerometer and triggers an alert. Allows the user to confirm they are OK or automatically sends an SOS message to emergency contacts with the phone's current location.
- Haptic Navigation: Use the phone's GPS to send navigational directions as left/right vibration prompts to the user.
- SOS Contact Management: Allows users to save and manage a list of emergency contacts that can be alerted in case of a fall or emergency situation.
- Custom Alert Sounds: Offers the ability to set up customized alerts based on distinct, recognizable patterns of haptic vibration, giving the user an increased level of app personalization.
